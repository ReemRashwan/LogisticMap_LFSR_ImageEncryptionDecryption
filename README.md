# Image Encryption and Decryption Using Logistic Map Equation and Linear Feedback Shift.
This program implements the encryption and decryption algorithm introduced in:
'Image Encryption and Decryption using Chaotic Key Sequence Generated by Sequence of Logistic Map and Sequence of States of Linear Feedback Shift' research paper. 

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

The program generates a sequence of N keys (N = number of image pixel) and then it XORs these keys with the original image pixels to produce the encrypted image. The decryption process is done by XORing the encrypted image pixels with the sequence of keys that was used to encrypt the original image. *Note: use Octave*

## KEY GENERATION STEPS:
1. Generate a sequence of keys using logistic map equation.
2. Generate a sequence of keys using linear feedback shift register.
3. XOR the binary version of the previous sequences to form the final key sequence.

## ENCRYPTION STEPS:
1. Split colored img channels. 
2. Convert each pixel value into block of 8-bits.
3. XOR the final key sequence with the binary image pixels.

## DECRYPTION STEPS:
1. Split encrypted img channels. 
2. Convert each pixel value into block of 8-bits.
3. XOR the key sequence (which was used to encrypt the image) with encrypted img pixels.
